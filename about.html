    <h3>Lose Weight with MyFitnessPal.com â€” for FREE!</h3>
    <div id="text">
      <p>
        Losing weight isn't easy - we know. But with a membership to
        MyFitnessPal.com, you'll get the tools you need to successfully take
        weight off - and keep it off. And best of all, you can signup for free,
        no strings attached. So put away your credit card - you'll never have to
        pay a cent. <br /><br />

        Study after study has confirmed the benefits of keeping track of the
        food you eat and the activity you do. It's simple - the more
        consistently you track your food intake, the more likely you are to lose
        weight. That's why every successful weight management program suggests
        that you keep a food diary and/or an activity log. But recording
        everything you eat without the right tools can be tedious at best, or
        simply impossible at worst. <br /><br />

        At MyFitnessPal.com, we focus on making sure you can log your meals as
        quickly and easily as possible. Because the easier we make it for you,
        the more likely you are to stay on track, and the more likely you are to
        succeed in your weight loss goals.<br /><br />

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          The reason our system is so easy to use is because
          <b>it learns from you!</b> All of us tend to eat the same foods over
          time. <b>MyFitnessPal.com</b> remembers what you've eaten and done
          most often in the past, and makes it easy for you to add those foods
          again to your log. <br /><br />

          <b>So the more you track your meals, the easier it becomes!</b>
